# Todo List

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rogerhil/todolist.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rogerhil/todolist)

Todo List is a TopTal test project

## Requirements

Write a todo list management web application where:

 - I can have my todo list displayed.
 - I can manipulate my list (add/remove/modify entries).
 - Assign priorities and due dates to the entries.
 - I can sort my entry lists using due date and priority.
 - I can mark an entry as completed.
 - Minimal UI/UX design is needed.
 - I need every client operation done using JavaScript, reloading the page is
   not an option.
 - Write a RESTful API which will allow a third-party application to trigger
   actions on your app (same actions available on the webpage).
 - You need to be able to pass credentials to both the webpage and the API.
 - As complementary to the last item, one should be able to create users in the
   system via an interface, probably a signup/register screen.
